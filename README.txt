https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17344

The task consists of detecting one of the 20 emoji labels from a dataset of English US-based tweets.
The official ranking was computed using macro f1 (sklearn implementation) and accuracy.

There are three subdirectories: train, test, and dev. The mapping file maps each emoji to a number between 0 and 20.
